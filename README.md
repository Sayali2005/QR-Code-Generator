# QR-Code-Generator
This project is a QR Code Generator built using Python and an API that takes a URL as input and generates a corresponding QR code.
QR Code Generator using Python & API
This is a QR Code Generator built using Python and an external API. The tool takes a URL as input and generates a corresponding QR code, which can be scanned using any QR code reader.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
User Input: Users can input any URL or text they want to convert into a QR code.

API Integration: Uses a third-party API to generate QR codes.

GUI Interface: Built with Tkinter for a simple graphical user interface, making it easy to use.

Save/Download QR Code: The generated QR code can be saved to your local system.

Cross-platform: The program should work on multiple operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Python ‚Äì Programming language used to build the application.

Tkinter ‚Äì Python library used to build the graphical user interface (GUI).

API (QR code generation) ‚Äì Used for generating the QR code based on the provided URL.

Goal of the Project:
The project demonstrates the use of Python programming, API integration, and GUI development to solve a practical problem‚Äîcreating QR codes from URLs. It was designed as a hands-on project to apply concepts learned in Python programming and GUI development.
